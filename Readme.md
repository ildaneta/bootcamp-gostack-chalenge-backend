## :pushpin: Motivation

In this challenge, the proposal for a solution was to make the automated tests pass, and for that, it was necessary to create a REST API on repositories, where the CRUD of the repositories was performed and an additional route was created that will serve to add likes on a repository.

- JEST
- Uuidv4
- Express
- Nodemon

## :heavy_check_mark: Installation

1. First, you need to have NodeJS and Yarn installed, then, to clone the project via HTTPS, run the following command:

2. If you already have a registered SSH key, you can perform the clone via SSH through the command:
